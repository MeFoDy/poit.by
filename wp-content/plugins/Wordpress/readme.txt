This plugin allows your site to interact with the nibl microtransaction service

== Description ==

We believe online content quality and quantity will diminish rapidly if content creators
are unable to find a viable mechanism to be paid for their work. We believe that consumers
are willing to pay for unique, high-quality content, such as news, music, video, and blogs
if the price point is low enough, the transaction process is easy enough, and a long term
commitment to multiple websites is not required. Furthermore, we believe a micropayment
system will only be adopted if registering as a publisher and integrating the paywall
technology into the publisher’s site is easy.
